# Weather-Dashboard: Server Side APIs

## Task

 The task was to create a weather dashboard that could run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The city weather data is retrieved from the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) server-side API. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are (green) favorable, (yellow) moderate, or (red) severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
